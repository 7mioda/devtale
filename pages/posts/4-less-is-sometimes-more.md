# Less is Sometimes More

When you first start working in tech, the appeal is often in the perks. The flashy gear, the dual or triple monitor setups, the standing desks, the cool dev toolsâ€”it all feels like part of becoming a "real" developer. And honestly, it's exciting at first.

But what we don't see right away is the other side of the job: the bugs, the tight deadlines, the office politics, and sometimes difficult team dynamics. (Okay, maybe not *everything* is darkâ€”but you get the idea.)

So, we get comfortable. We start believing that more tools, more screens, and more gadgets means more productivity. But surprisingly, that's not always true.

Over the past three months, due to some family commitments, I found myself constantly on the move. I had to adapt to a very minimal setupâ€”just my 14-inch MacBook. No external monitors, no fancy keyboard, no extra space. Just one screen.

And you know what? It changed the way I work.

With only one screen, I couldn't multitask the way I used to. I had to focusâ€”really focusâ€”on one task at a time. No Slack or email on a second screen. No browser tabs silently demanding attention. Just the code in front of me.

And the result? I became more productive. More intentional. I finished tasks faster and with fewer mistakes. I was less distracted and more present in what I was doing.

It turns out, sometimes **less really is more**. Not because we're missing anything, but because we're cutting out the noise.
