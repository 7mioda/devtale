# Frontend Architecture Dilemma

The journey started five years ago when our CTO pushed the very first commit to our frontend app. Back then, **React + TypeScript** (with Create React App) was the obvious go-to stack. With the hype surrounding **GraphQL**, adopting it felt like a prestigious and natural choice.

But, like many early-stage startups, we moved fast ‚Äî maybe too fast. Our codebase quickly devolved into a **big ball of mud**. Every component, style, and type became deeply coupled to another part of the app. Bugs were hard to trace, and refactoring felt like going in circles. We weren't moving forward ‚Äî we were treading water in ambiguity.

Eventually, we hit a tipping point. We had to find a better way ‚Äî not just for maintainability, but to keep our sanity intact.

Two architectural ideas emerged:

- **Centralized orchestration**
- **Isolated, vertical slices**

## **Centralized Orchestration (The Widget + Context Pattern)**

The first solution was to create **feature widgets** ‚Äî each wrapped in its own **React Context**. This context would be responsible for:

- Fetching initial data
- Exposing all available actions (e.g., create, update, delete)
- Sharing relevant state with child components

At first, this felt clean. Each feature had a boundary. But as features grew in complexity, we realized we'd just broken the original problem into **N smaller problems**:

- Each context began exposing **more data and actions than any one consumer needed**.
- Many exposed actions were fired only 10% of the time.
- Onboarding devs had to dig into context internals just to understand how a component worked.
- Coordinating across contexts was **harder** than we thought.

Ultimately, we were just **moving complexity**, not eliminating it.

## **Isolated Components & Vertical Slices (Keep It Simple)**

The second solution was more grounded: **embrace simplicity and isolate responsibility**.

We decided:

- Use **state and context only when absolutely necessary**.
- **Push state down the React tree** as much as possible (minimizing unnecessary renders and improving performance).
- Let each component **own its logic**: data fetching, mutations, side effects ‚Äî all encapsulated within.

Because we were using **Apollo Client**, many of our concerns around syncing data across components were already handled. Components connected to the same query would re-render automatically on mutation ‚Äî no extra coupling needed.

This approach wasn't just simpler. It was **more aligned with how React wants to be used**.

## What we learned

- Don't architect for flexibility you don't yet need.
- Contexts are powerful, but overuse can lead to **fragility**, not **scalability**.
- Smaller, self-contained components are **easier to onboard**, **test**, and **scale**.
- If you're using a smart data layer like Apollo or React Query, you already have a lot of shared-state magic ‚Äî don't reinvent it.

## **Final Thoughts**

There's no silver bullet. But when you're growing a team and building under pressure, **simplicity wins**. The vertical slice approach made our app easier to reason about and gave us confidence to build faster ‚Äî without the fear of breaking everything.

We're still learning, but we've come a long way from the mud. üõ†Ô∏è

This will be the first in a series of articles on our journey to build a better frontend ‚Äî tomorrow, in Tomorro.
