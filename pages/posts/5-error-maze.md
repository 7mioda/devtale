# The Error Maze

Errors can be painful. Confusing. Frustrating. But they can also be a weirdly great place to learn if you don't let them break your spirit.

Like Churchill, we should keep going. Keep smiling. Keep trying.

But let's be honest: some errors (especially in production) feel like being trapped in a **maze of logs**, with nothing but broken breadcrumbs to guide you. It's a black hole. You start your day full of hope and six hours later, you're still staring at the same vague stack trace.

**What a waste, hein?**

## **Tools are great, but...**

I've used tools like **@Datadog** and **@NewRelic** and they're amazing. Truly. But the problem is rarely the tool.

It's **how we throw and shape our errors**.

Too often, we treat error handling like an afterthought:
> Will this help someone fix the problem… or will it ruin their day?
> 

That someone might be you.
