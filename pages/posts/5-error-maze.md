# The Error Maze

Errors can be painful. Confusing. Frustrating. But they can also be a weirdly great place to learn — if you don't let them break your spirit.

Like Churchill, we should keep going. Keep smiling. Keep trying.

But let's be honest: some errors — *especially in production* — feel like being trapped in a **maze of logs**, with nothing but broken breadcrumbs to guide you. It's a black hole. You start your day full of hope and six hours later, you're still staring at the same vague stack trace.

**What a waste, hein?**

## **Tools are great, but…**

I've used tools like **@Datadog** and **@NewRelic** — and they're amazing. Truly. But the problem is rarely the tool.

It's **how we throw and shape our errors**.

Too often, we treat error handling like an afterthought:

```ts
 catch (e) => console.error('something went wrong')
 throw new Error('Oops')
```

Because hey, we're engineers — our code doesn't break, right?

But reality disagrees. And when it does, we hand over a mystery box of sadness to our future self (or teammate). A broken feature, a cryptic log, and no idea what actually happened.

## **So here's my advice, dev to dev:**

When you write an error, think of it like **sending a message through time** —

a little **Interstellar-style ping** to your future self stuck in production hell.

🧠 Take two more minutes.

🛠️ Add real context: what was the user doing? Which ID? What input broke?

🔒 Don't expose secrets — but *do* leave breadcrumbs.

### **TL;DR:**

- Errors aren't the enemy — lack of clarity is.
- Your error messages should *talk* to your future self.
- A good error saves hours. A bad one adds days.
- Observability isn't just about tools. It's about empathy.

Next time you're in a try/catch, ask yourself:

That someone might be you.
