# Disagree and Commit

When you start a software company, one thing becomes obvious pretty quickly: you can't do it alone. Even early on, you'll need more than one developer to keep things moving. And once you have a team‚Äîespecially if you're hiring talented, opinionated engineers‚Äîyou're going to face disagreements.

That's where the real challenge begins. It's not just a technical problem; it's a people problem. In software, especially, engineers are used to autonomy. Each one often has a strong view of the "right" way to build something.

As the team grows, the ability to navigate different perspectives‚Äîon architecture, product direction, or even culture‚Äîbecomes essential. That kind of maturity doesn't come easy. It's not just about agreeing with someone else's technical choice; it's about trusting that person enough to let go of your own idea when necessary.

This is why hiring isn't just a tactical move‚Äîit's foundational. Bringing the right people on board isn't just about talent. It's about shared values, communication, and the willingness to grow together. And it's what makes the difference between a startup that stays afloat and one that sinks under the weight of its own internal conflict.
