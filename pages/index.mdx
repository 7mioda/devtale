# Devtail

Welcome to Devtail - my personal blog where I document my journey through software development, sharing insights, learnings, and experiences along the way. ✨

Hi, I'm Ahmed! 👋 I currently work at Tomorro and enjoy working on various side projects in my free time. Here, you'll find articles about software engineering practices, technical tutorials, and reflections on my development journey. 💻

I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge with the developer community. Through Devtail, I aim to create a trail of discoveries and lessons that might help other developers on their own paths. 🌱
